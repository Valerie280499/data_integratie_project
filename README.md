# data_integratie_project
Authors: Valerie Verhalle and Anne Manders

How to run the docker containers:
  Make sure you have the Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml and app.py in the same directory(data_integratie_project)
  In the terminal, go to the data_integratie_project directory
  Then, enter the following commands:
  - sudo docker service start
  - sudo docker-compose up
  This should create the containers. They take up about 2.5 GB in storage space, so keep that in mind.
  
  Enter the database container by entering:
  - mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=32000 -u root -p
    (then enter the password indicated in the YML file)
    You should be located at the sql prompt in the database container. Verify this by entering:
    - SHOW DATABASES;
    You should see *data_integratie_project* among them
    - USE data_integratie_project;
    - SHOW TABLES;
    You should see the table *variant*.
    Enter 'exit' and press enter to leave mysql.
    
    click the '0.0.0.0:5000' link, generated by docker-compose to be redirected to the webapp.

If you need to remake the containers:
  if docker-compose is still running, enter:
    - sudo docker-compose down
  otherwise manually stop and remove the database and app container, like so:
    - sudo docker container ls -a, to get an overview of all created containers
    - sudo docker stop <CONTAINER ID>, (twice, once for each container)
    - sudo docker rm <CONTAINER ID>, (dito)
    - sudo docker system prune -a, then enter yes (!!!Be careful! This will remove ALL containers and images!!!)
    - sudo docker-compose up, to restart the process of creating the containers
  
  I did it this way because my computer couldn't handle 'docker-compose up --build', seeing as it generated those 2.5 GB all over again. But, if you have the processing power, you can also, instead of the manual removal, enter after 'docker-compose down':
- sudo docker-compose up --build


And that should do it!!
