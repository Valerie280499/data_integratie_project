# data_integratie_project
Authors: Valerie Verhalle and Anne Manders

### How to run the docker containers:
Make sure you have the Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml and app.py in the same directory(data_integratie_project) <br/>
In the terminal, go to the data_integratie_project directory <br/>
Then, enter the following commands:
```
sudo docker service start
sudo docker-compose up
```
This should create the containers. They take up about 2.5 GB in storage space, so keep that in mind. <br/><br/>

Enter the database container by entering:
```mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=32000 -u root -p```
Then enter the password indicated in the YML file. <br/>
You should be located at the sql prompt in the database container. Verify this by entering:
```SHOW DATABASES;```
You should see *data_integratie_project* among them
```
USE data_integratie_project;
SHOW TABLES;
```
You should see the table *variant*.
Enter 'exit' and press enter to leave mysql.
    
The webapp should already be up and running, so click the '0.0.0.0:5000' link, generated by docker-compose(scroll up in the docker-compose output), to be redirected to open it in the browser.<br/><br/>

If you need to remake the containers:
  If docker-compose is still running, enter:
    ```sudo docker-compose down```
  Otherwise manually stop and remove the database and app container, like so:
    To get an overview of all created containers, enter:
    ```
    sudo docker container ls -a,
    ```
    Twice, once for each container enter:
    ```
    sudo docker stop <CONTAINER ID>
    sudo docker rm <CONTAINER ID>
    ```
    Then enter:
    ```sudo docker system prune -a```
    Then enter yes to let the pruning continue (!!!Be careful! This will remove ALL containers and images!!!) <br/>
    To restart the process of creating the containers, enter:
    ```sudo docker-compose up```
  
I did it this way because my computer couldn't handle 'docker-compose up --build', seeing as it generated those 2.5 GB all over again. But, if you have the processing power, you can also, instead of the manual removal, enter after 'docker-compose down':
  ```sudo docker-compose up --build```


And that should do it!!
